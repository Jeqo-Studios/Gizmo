- Toggle join and quit messages from showing in the chat.
- Play a sound when the player successfully loads the server resource pack and upon advancing from the screen.
- Display a unique first join welcome screen and background. After the player's first join, they will see the default screen.
- Configurable Unicodes; easy to merge with existing resource packs or plugins like Oraxen and ItemsAdder.
- Option to toggle the welcome screen and first join welcome screen.
- Ability to add up to 89 items per screen (material, custom model data, slot, name, and lore options).
